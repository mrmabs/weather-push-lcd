# Push Weather to Arduino LCD

This script runs on any computer capable of running python, grabs weather observation data in json format from the Australian Bureau of Meterology and sends the information to an Arduino with Ethernet shield and 16x2 display running the sketch found here: https://github.com/evjrob/html-to-lcd

You will need to edit for your own region and the IP address of your Arduino.
